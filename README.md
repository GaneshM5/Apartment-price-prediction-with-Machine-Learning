# Apartment-price-prediction-with-Machine-Learning

A house value is simply more than location and square footage. This project is focused to educate a potential buyer or seller to know all aspects that give a house its value.
We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyse and predict house prices.
We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.
